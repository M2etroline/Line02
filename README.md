# 3D Encryption

In this project we fill a 3D space with points, so that from one particular angle, position and FOV the encrypted image is seen. Of course that is just the visual representation of what the programme is doing.

How the encryption works.

Image of letter "H". I appears as shifted because we are projecting a square image to a circle.

From GUI the user can select options regarding encryption space, noise, and selecting files to encrypt. It takes in binary image saved as '0' and '1'. It operates on very small images: 50x50 pix takes around a minute to decrypt.

This project is not at all comparable to newer (and old) techniques of encryption. It is an educational experiment, a presentation of what encrypting data, and using a key means. But all in all, it was just a fun idea that we wanted to implement.
